# Breastcancer.genomics
Breast cancer genomics is the study of the complete set of DNA, including all genes, within a breast cancer cell. Unlike traditional genetics (which looks at inherited risks like BRCA1), genomics focuses on the behavior of the tumor itself—how it mutates, grows, and responds to drugs.
2. Key Driver Mutations
Genomic sequencing identifies specific "drivers"—mutations that push the cancer to grow. The most common ones currently targeted in 2026 include:

PIK3CA (30–40% of cases): The most frequent mutation in HR+ breast cancer. It activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, helping cells survive.

TP53: Often found in the aggressive Basal-like/Triple-Negative subtypes; it indicates a loss of tumor suppression.

ESR1: Frequently emerges as a "resistance mutation" after a patient has been on hormone therapy, causing the cancer to ignore standard drugs.

HER2 (ERBB2): While usually an amplification (too many copies), actual mutations in the HER2 gene are now being targeted with specific tyrosine-kinase inhibitors like Neratinib.
